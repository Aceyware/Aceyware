# Welcome to the sanctuary of good software like old days.
Aceyware is an organisation of software in various fields made by [a single person](https://github.com/PEPSIMANTR) with flesh and bones only, aiming simple yet performant software development as a rebellion to today's piles of *soyware*s. 
Founded with hate, confience and, at some point, with a broken heart. 

## Software as you used to know
- Works fast and efficient on resources
- Free of spyware and other goy stuff
- Doesn't screw its users up
- Solely made by human (instead of some LLM shit)


And in additon to those
- Free and open source as much as possible
- Does not care about 'things' that is imposed to people, often along with software.

## Things Aceyware does
